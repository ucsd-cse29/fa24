# Week 9 - More UNIX Commands

## Welcome to Week 9

The goal of this week's lab is to introduce you to various new and interesting UNIX commands and features to help you get more comfortable with working on a terminal environment!

To get started, **login to `ieng6`** and fork and clone this [repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse29/lab9-starter) which contains the various files needed for the lab and `cd` into the `lab9-starter` directory.

If you see the following upon running `ls`, you're ready to get started!

```
~/cse29/lab9-starter$ ls
Makefile  README.md  message.txt  pokemon  problem.c
```

## Lab Goals

1. [Searching and Filtering Program Output](./redirect.md)
2. [Flow like Water with Pipes](./pipes.md)
3. [Pokemon Mailtime!](./mail.md)
