# Pushing PA2 Code Github from `ieng6`

Make sure your `ieng6` account has [Github access](https://ucsd-cse29.github.io/fa24/week3/index.html#42---git-cli-commands).

1. Get your PA2 code onto ieng6; if you've already done a step, skip it
    - Follow the Github Classroom link from the [assignment page](https://github.com/ucsd-cse29/pa2-hashing-and-passwords) to create it
    - Log into ieng6 and clone the repository that was just made using `git clone [your-repository-link]`
    - Change into the directory with your PA2 repository

2. Check what's up by running `git status`. This will tell you (from the
command-line) what's going in the copy of your code you have checked out in the current working directory.
