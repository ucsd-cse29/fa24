Work on your PA3! Your tutors are here to help.

You are welcome to work with your classmates, share ideas, and so on.

- You loading a URL via curl or browser a request on one of your classmates'
  chat servers that shows adding at least one chat, or part of a chat.
- One of your classmates loading a URL via curl or browser on _your_
  chat server that shows adding at least one chat, or part of a chat.
