# Week 6 – Work on PA3 (Chat Server)

Work on your PA3! Your tutors are here to help.

You are welcome to work with your classmates, share ideas, and so on.

In your notes doc, you should be able to show by the end of the lab:

- You loading a URL via curl or browser a request on one of your classmates'
  chat servers that shows adding at least one chat, or part of a chat.
- One of your classmates loading a URL via curl or browser on _your_
  chat server that shows adding at least one chat, or part of a chat.

If you think you're all the way done with PA3, here are some suggestions:

- Implement

  in your chat server.
- Right now the chat server allows anyone to post with any username. Brainstorm
  ways to have a user who uses a username first “claim” it somehow, so others
  can't. HINT: add a path for “registering” a username and share a secret
  between the server and the user to recognize them in the future.
