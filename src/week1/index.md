# Week 1 – Command Line and Running C Programs

## Lab Logistics

In this class, you are assigned to lab sections, in which you will be in the CSE basement lab rooms to work hands-on on activities related to the tools and techniques that you’ll be using on programming assignments.

Labs are graded by participation, based on your attendance and engagement with the lab activity. You will not need to submit anything at the end of the lab, but we will leave instructions throughout the lab activity for you to checkoff your work with a tutor. This helps us ensure that you are following the lab activity.

## Github Codespaces Setup

First thing for TA/tutor to test

(Have a Github account, copy the classroom Repo, make a codespace, sign up for student dev pack if needed)

**Write down in notes**: screenshots

## ieng6 login

Log into ieng6 from Github codespace with ssh from that terminal

**Write down in notes**: screenshots

## Run simple commands

cat, curl, ls, cd, mkdir, pwd and maybe a few others

**Write down in notes**: some descriptions

## Build a C program (in both places)

Give them Hello.c from class, build + run both in Codespace and on ieng6.

Do something to make it have different behavior on the two systems! (environment
var, file, hostname, etc)

`ls ..` to show username dirs on ieng6, different layout entirely in the codespace

**Write down in notes**: compare/contrast

## Edit a C Program

fgets and/or CLI option

**Write down in notes**: some code
