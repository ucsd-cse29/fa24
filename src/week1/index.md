# Week 1 ‚Äì Command Line and Running C Programs

## Lab Logistics

In this class, you are assigned to lab sections, in which you will be in the CSE basement lab rooms to work hands-on on activities related to the tools and techniques that you‚Äôll be using on programming assignments.

Labs are graded by participation, based on your attendance and engagement with the lab activity. Throughout the lab, you will fill in a shared Google Doc with notes and results from what you try and learn. This will be shared with the group of students around you so you have a collective record of your activities (and so we can comment on your progress!)

Your TA lab lead will share the link to the Google Doc with you at the beginning of the lab.

## Github

Much of our work this quarter will happen through [Github](http://github.com), which is a platform for sharing code and collaborating on projects. You should make sure you have a Github account ‚Äì¬†you're free to use an existing one if you already have one. We will make use of the resources available in the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application?type=student). This may require signing up with a `@ucsd.edu` email address, or adding it to your account, in order to verify your student status.

### Making an Account

For this lab, you **do** need to make a Github account right away. You **do not** need the Student developer pack yet, but you should submit the application in lab if possible so that you'll have the needed resources going forward.

**Write down in your Google Doc**:

For each student, their `@ucsd` email and their Github username they will use for this class (this is helpful for the TAs to know who is who!), and a link to their Github profile, which looks something like [https://github.com/jpolitz/](https://github.com/jpolitz/).

### Making a Repository

From your Github profile page, click the `+` in the upper right to make a new **repository** (you can call it something like `lab1`). For lab work, your repositories can be _public_ (for assignments we will show you how to make them be _private_).

**Definition**: A **repository** is a place to store code and other files. It has some similarities to a shared folder in Google Drive: it stores a collection of files and folders, and there are ways to share it with others. The main special thing about repositories is that they store a detailed history of changes to files, which turns out to be really important for programming projects.

There are many ways to interact with a repository; we'll see a few today and many more throughout the quarter. After you create the repository, you'll see a page like this:

... FILL SCREENSHOT ...

For a first step, you'll make a README file directly on `github.com`. Click the `Add a README` button, and you'll be taken to an editor where you can write some text. You can write anything you like for this first test; when you're done, click the `Commit new file` button at the bottom.

**Write down in your Google Doc**:

For each student, a screenshot of their repository after adding the README file. If anyone ran into errors or issues, describe them!

### Github Codespaces

Github has a feature called [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) that provide an online environment for the full development process ‚Äì¬†writing code, running programs, and managing a repository. We'll use this feature throughout the course to have a standardized programming environment for everyone; Codespaces is also similar to many production environments in tech companies and research labs.

For this lab, we'll create a Codespace to do our work. Click the `Code` button on your repository page, and then click the `New Codespace` button:

... FILL SCREENSHOT ...

This will open a new Codespace (sometimes it takes a minute to start up), which will look like this:

... FILL SCREENSHOT ...

(A cute name will be randomly generated for each new Codespace you make.)

The `README` file you made can be seen in the file navigation on the left. You can click on it to open it in a new editor tab (it may have opened by default when the Codespace started, as well). You can type into it to make edits.

**Do now**: Type some edits into the `README` file. Then, open a *new tab* and go find the repository again from your Github page. Do you see the edits to the file there?

**Write down in your Google Doc**: For each student, a screenshot of the edited text in your Codespace, and a screenshot of the repository on Github showing the contents of the README.

To propagate the changes from our Codespace to the repository, we need to **commit** and **push** them. We'll talk in detail about these in future labs and lectures; for now we'll just show you how in the Codespace interface and defer explanations to later.

On the left sidebar there is a ‚ÄúSource Control‚Äù icon. Click on this, you'll see a `M` next to your README file listing, which means ‚Äúmodified‚Äù. Click on the `+` next to the `M` to stage the changes. Then, write a short message in the text box (something simple like ‚ÄúEdited README‚Äù¬†suffices). Finally, click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

Then, click the three dots next to the checkmark and choose ‚ÄúPush‚Äù. This will send the changes to the repository on Github.

**Write down in your Google Doc**: For each student, a screenshot of the repository on Github showing the contents of the README including the edits.

### Github Codespaces Summary

In this intro, you've:

- Set up your Github account
- Created a repository on Github
- Created a file through the Github editing interface
- Created a Codespace
- Edited the file in the Codespace
- Committed and pushed the changes to your repository

You'll use all of this setup many times throughout the quarter, and likely the same or similar steps thousands of times throughout your programming career! üöÄ

## Terminal and ieng6 login

A working systems programmer spends a fair amount of time at the **terminal** ‚Äì¬†a text-based interface to a computer. In this course we'll make heavy use of the terminal, both for running programs and for interacting with the system.

In your Codespace, you can open a Terminal by clicking the `Terminal` menu and choosing `New Terminal`. This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the screen. You can also press `Ctrl-\`` (hold down the Control key and press backtick, the key to the left of 1 on the keyboard).

### Navigation Commands

Try running the following commands in your Codespace terminal. To run a command, type it in and press enter.

`pwd`

`ls`

`ls .`

`cat README.md`

`cat README`

`cat does-not-exist`

`mkdir myfirstfolder`

`cd myfirstfolder`

`ls`

`ls .`

`pwd`

`touch file1.txt`

`touch file2.txt`

`ls`

`rm file2.txt`

`ls`

`ls ..`

`cd ..`

`pwd`

`ls`

`ls myfirstfolder`

**Discuss in your group and write down in notes**: For each command you just ran, include both a copy-paste of output you see at the terminal and any changes you see in the file navigation as observations of the command's behavior. Then, for the commands `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `touch`, `cat`, do your best to give a general description of the command. If you're not sure, that's okay! We'll talk more about all of these going forward, and after you are done trying this out, a staff member will add some definitions we have for them to your notes doc to make sure we have agreed-upon summaries.

### Downloading a File From the Command Line

Run the following command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucsd-cse29/fa24/refs/heads/main/src/lec/week1/hello.c
```

You should see the contents of an example from class. Then run this command:

```
curl -o hello.c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucsd-cse29/fa24/refs/heads/main/src/lec/week1/hello.c
```

You should see the file `hello.c` from class downloaded and saved into your Codespace. You can observe it in the file navigation, and with `ls` and `cat` (try all of them!).

Try opening the link from above in your browser.

`curl` takes a URL (a link) and downloads the contents. The optional `-o somefile` **command-line option** or **command-line flag** specifies an output file to save the contents to.

**Definition**: A **command-line option** or **command-line flag** is a way to give extra information to a program. Options are usually specified with a dash (`-`) followed by a letter or word. For example, `-o` is an option for `curl` that specifies an output file. The full list of options and flags is usually available by doing a search for the program online, or by using the command `man` (short for ‚Äúmanual‚Äù, nothing to do with dudes). Try running `man curl` at the terminal (the result may ‚Äútake over‚Äù your terminal, you can use the up and down arrows to scroll and `q` to get back to the command prompt).

### Logging into `ieng6`

As a student, you are assigned an account on the `ieng6` server hosted by UCSD. These are similar to accounts you might get on other systems at other institutions (or a future job). We‚Äôll see how to use your machine to connect to a remote computer over the Internet to do work there.

Your account name is the same account name as the one that‚Äôs used for your school Google account, i.e. it is the string that precedes ‚Äú@ucsd.edu‚Äù in your school email address. In case you need to check the status of your student account, refer to the [UCSD Student Account Lookup page](https://sal.ucsd.edu/).

Next run this command (with `yourusername` replaced by your actual username):

```
ssh yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

Since this is likely the first time you‚Äôve connected to this server, you will probably get a message like this:

```
$ ssh yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Copy and paste the one of the corresponding listed public key fingerprints and press enter.

TODO (staff, check these)

- If you see the phrase **ED25519 key fingerprint** answer with: SHA256:8vAtB6KpnYXm5dYczS0M9sotRVhvD55GYz8EjN1DYgs
- If you see the phrase **ECDSA key fingerprint** answer with: SHA256:/bQ70BSkHU8AEUqommBUhdAg0M4GaFIHLKq0YQyKvmw
- If you see the phrase **RSA key fingerprint** answer with: SHA256:npmS8Gk0l+zAXD0nNGUxr7hLeYPn7zzhYWVKxlfNaeQ

(Getting the fingerprint from a trusted source is the best thing to do here. You can also just type ‚Äúyes‚Äù, as it's pretty unlikely anything nefarious is going on. If you get this message when you're connecting to a server you connect to often, it could mean someone is trying to listen in on or control the connection. This answer is a decent description of what's going on and how you might calibrate your own risk assessment: [Ben Voigt's answer](https://superuser.com/questions/421074/ssh-the-authenticity-of-host-host-cant-be-established/421084#421084).)

After this, you get a prompt to enter your password. This is the same password you use to log into your student account on other websites, like Canvas and Tritonlink. The terminal itself does not show what you type when you enter your password. This is conventionally done for your own security, so that others looking at your screen don‚Äôt see it. Just trust that it gets inputted when you type.

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any commands you run will run on that computer! We call your computer the client and the computer in the basement the server based on how you are connected.

The whole interaction will look something like this:

```
# On your client
$ ssh yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6-202.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
Password:

To begin work for one of your courses [ cs15lwi24 ], type its name
at the command prompt.  (For example, "cs15lwi24", without the quotes).

To see all available software packages, type "prep -l" at the command prompt,
or "prep -h" for more options
```

Then, execute the following command:

```
cs15lfa24
```

You should get the following output:

```
Tue Oct 01, 2024 11:28pm - Prepping cs15lfa24
```

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any commands you run will run on that computer! We call your computer the client and the computer in the basement the server based on how you are connected.

If, in this process, you run into errors and can't figure out how to proceed, ask! When you ask, take a screenshot of your problem and add it to your group's running notes document, then describe what the fix was. If you don't know how to take a screenshot, ask!

### Running Commands, Remotely

Run all the commands from the earlier section again, while logged into `ieng6` in the terminal. Include the `curl` commands as well.

**Discuss and write down in notes**: For each command, compare its output to what you got in the Codespace. Discuss any differences you see. Which commands work identically? Which seem to have different behavior? Why might that be? What does it mean for a file to be ‚Äúin‚Äù¬†your Codespace vs. ‚Äúin‚Äù¬†your ieng6 account?

## Running C Programs

Sometimes we will work in the Codespace, and other times it will be important to do work on `ieng6`. This mirrors common practice in industry and research labs, where you may do some development locally, while other times you have to configure, edit, or run programs on a specific machine. In this part of the lab we'll see how to build and run a C program (like the one from class) in both places.

At this point you should have `hello.c` present in your Codespace and in your `ieng6` account.

### Compiling and Running in Both Places 

You can open more than one terminal in your Codespace, and in fact you can see more than one terminal at a time. There is a little icon in the top right of the terminal that looks like a square with a plus sign in it. Clicking that will open a new terminal. You can also drag the tab of a terminal to the side of the screen to create a new panel, and you can see both terminals at the same time. You may want to try that for this activity! New terminals in your Codespace will always open in the context of your Codespace, **not** logged into `ieng6`.

Open two terminals, one logged into `ieng6` and one in your Codespace.

In both, run the following commands one at a time:

```
ls
gcc hello.c -o hello
ls
./hello
```

**Write down in notes**: What effect did the `gcc` command have? What did the `./hello` command do?

Some definitions:
- `gcc` is a compiler for C programs. It takes `.c` files (and other things we'll see later) as inputs, and generates **executable files** (like `hello`) as outputs.
- An **executable file** is specially encoded with instructions for a specific (type of) machine. We won't talk in much detail about it in this course, but the way an executable file runs on a computer is one of the the main topics of CSE30. These files can be run without any other tools. When we run `hello` by writing `./hello`, we are directly telling the operating system to run the instructions in that file.

### Making an Edit

Next, in your Codespace editor, make an edit to `hello.c` to change the string message to one of your choice. Save the file, then rerun the commands above in **both** terminals.

**Write down in notes**: What was the output in each terminal? What did you observe about the behavior of the program in each place?

When you change the file in your Codespace, the file on `ieng6` **does not change**. You can use `cat` to verify this; the edit you made is only to the file stored in your Codespace. This is an important concept! Each computer has its own **filesystem** that stores files and folders. Each terminal is connected to one computer (and to one filesystem) at a time. Knowing which computer you're running commands on is really important for that reason!

It's worth asking how we can get our edits onto `ieng6` to run the modified program there. There is a command, related to `ssh`, called `scp`, that does just that.

From your terminal connected to your Codespace, run this command (replacing `yourusername` with your username as before; you will be prompted for your password again):

```
scp hello.c yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu:./
```

Then, in your terminal connected to `ieng6`, run the following commands:

```
cat hello.c
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

The command `scp` takes files and copies them to the computer and folder given by the second argument. The `:` is separating the username and name of the server from the path or folder to copy it into ‚Äì `./` just means ‚Äúthe current folder‚Äù, which is the same folder you see when you log in. `scp` is a useful command for moving things around between computers. There are many other ways we could accomplish this, but this is one of the most direct.


**Write down in notes**: For each student, take a screenshot of successfully running the `scp` command and then using `cat` to see the new output on `ieng6`, and put it in the notes.

## Summary

- A **repository** is a place to store code; Github is a service for storing repositories
- A **Codespace** is a web page that connects to a computer at Github that holds your repository and lets you run commands and edit your code
- A **terminal** is a text-based interface to a computer.
- We run **commands** in the terminal, which have **options** and **flags** and **arguments**. We can look up commands' behavior online or with `man`
- **commands** are programs that can do all kinds of things, from file management (`ls`, `cat`, `cd`) to connecting to other computers (`curl`, `ssh`) to compiling and running programs (`gcc`, `./hello`)
- We can connect to `ieng6`, which is a collection of computers at UCSD, using `ssh`. Many times we need to connect to other computers we will use `ssh`
- Each computer has its own **filesystem**, which is a collection of files and folders. We saw the Codespace filesystem and the `ieng6` filesystem
- We can compile C programs using `gcc` which creates **executable files**
- We can run **executable files** with `./filename`
- The `scp` command can be used to move files between computers (using the same login as `ssh`)

## More Practice

These are open-ended exercises for you to try and discuss with your group. These are also great conversation-starters for office hours, deeper understanding with friends outside of class, or conceptual questions on Piazza. Feel free to take your results and **write down in notes** what you found!

- Commit and push your changes to `hello.c` Github. Can you figure out how to download the code you wrote from Github to `ieng6` using `curl`? (Hint: inspect the URLs we shared for downloading class code)
- Try creating a new `.c` file from scratch that prints something different. Compile and run it in both your Codespace and on `ieng6`, using your method of choice to move it to `ieng6`.
- Try running the `scp` command without the `./` at the end of the path. What happens?
- Use `scp` to copy a file into a different folder on `ieng6` (like the one you made with `mkdir`). What does the command look like?
- Cause an error in `hello.c` (change the name of `main`, or drop a `"`, or otherwise cause an issue), then recompile and re-run. What does the `gcc` command output? What does the `./hello` command output? Why?
- Try running `gcc` without the `-o hello` part. What happens? What is the name of the output file? Can you run it?
- Try running `gcc` with the `-o` flag with a different name. What happens? What is the name of the output file? Can you run it?
- Run `ls ..` after logging into `ieng6`. What do you see?
