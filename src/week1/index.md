# Week 1 ‚Äì Command Line and Running C Programs

## Lab Logistics

In this class, you are assigned to lab sections, in which you will be in the CSE basement lab rooms to work hands-on on activities related to the tools and techniques that you‚Äôll be using on programming assignments.

Labs are graded by participation, based on your attendance and engagement with the lab activity. Throughout the lab, you will fill in a shared Google Doc with notes and results from what you try and learn. This will be shared with the group of students around you so you have a collective record of your activities (and so we can comment on your progress!)

Your TA lab lead will share the link to the Google Doc with you at the beginning of the lab.

## Github

Much of our work this quarter will happen through [Github](http://github.com), which is a platform for sharing code and collaborating on projects. You should make sure you have a Github account ‚Äì¬†you're free to use an existing one if you already have one. We will make use of the resources available in the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application?type=student). This may require signing up with a `@ucsd.edu` email address, or adding it to your account, in order to verify your student status.

### Making an Account

For this lab, you **do** need to make a Github account right away. You **do not** need the Student developer pack yet, but you should submit the application in lab if possible so that you'll have the needed resources going forward.

**Write down in your Google Doc**:

For each student, their `@ucsd` email and their Github username they will use for this class (this is helpful for the TAs to know who is who!), and a link to their Github profile, which looks something like [https://github.com/jpolitz/](https://github.com/jpolitz/).

### Making a Repository

From your Github profile page, click the `+` in the upper right to make a new **repository** (you can call it something like `lab1`). For lab work, your repositories can be _public_ (for assignments we will show you how to make them be _private_).

**Definition**: A **repository** is a place to store code and other files. It has some similarities to a shared folder in Google Drive: it stores a collection of files and folders, and there are ways to share it with others. The main special thing about repositories is that they store a detailed history of changes to files, which turns out to be really important for programming projects.

There are many ways to interact with a repository; we'll see a few today and many more throughout the quarter. After you create the repository, you'll see a page like this:

... FILL SCREENSHOT ...

For a first step, you'll make a README file directly on `github.com`. Click the `Add a README` button, and you'll be taken to an editor where you can write some text. You can write anything you like for this first test; when you're done, click the `Commit new file` button at the bottom.

**Write down in your Google Doc**:

For each student, a screenshot of their repository after adding the README file. If anyone ran into errors or issues, describe them!

### Github Codespaces

Github has a feature called [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) that provide an online environment for the full development process ‚Äì¬†writing code, running programs, and managing a repository. We'll use this feature throughout the course to have a standardized programming environment for everyone; Codespaces is also similar to many production environments in tech companies and research labs.

For this lab, we'll create a Codespace to do our work. Click the `Code` button on your repository page, and then click the `New Codespace` button:

... FILL SCREENSHOT ...

This will open a new Codespace (sometimes it takes a minute to start up), which will look like this:

... FILL SCREENSHOT ...

(A cute name will be randomly generated for each new Codespace you make.)

The `README` file you made can be seen in the file navigation on the left. You can click on it to open it in a new editor tab (it may have opened by default when the Codespace started, as well). You can type into it to make edits.

**Do now**: Type some edits into the `README` file. Then, open a *new tab* and go find the repository again from your Github page. Do you see the edits to the file there?

**Write down in your Google Doc**: For each student, a screenshot of the edited text in your Codespace, and a screenshot of the repository on Github showing the contents of the README.

To propagate the changes from our Codespace to the repository, we need to **commit** and **push** them. We'll talk in detail about these in future labs and lectures; for now we'll just show you how in the Codespace interface and defer explanations to later.

On the left sidebar there is a ‚ÄúSource Control‚Äù icon. Click on this, you'll see a `M` next to your README file listing, which means ‚Äúmodified‚Äù. Click on the `+` next to the `M` to stage the changes. Then, write a short message in the text box (something simple like ‚ÄúEdited README‚Äù¬†suffices). Finally, click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

Then, click the three dots next to the checkmark and choose ‚ÄúPush‚Äù. This will send the changes to the repository on Github.

**Write down in your Google Doc**: For each student, a screenshot of the repository on Github showing the contents of the README including the edits.

### Github Codespaces Summary

In this intro, you've:

- Set up your Github account
- Created a repository on Github
- Created a file through the Github editing interface
- Created a Codespace
- Edited the file in the Codespace
- Committed and pushed the changes to your repository

You'll use all of this setup many times throughout the quarter, and likely the same or similar steps thousands of times throughout your programming career! üöÄ

## Terminal and ieng6 login

A working systems programmer spends a fair amount of time at the **terminal** ‚Äì¬†a text-based interface to a computer. In this course we'll make heavy use of the terminal, both for running programs and for interacting with the system.

In your Codespace, you can open a Terminal by clicking the `Terminal` menu and choosing `New Terminal`. This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the screen. You can also press `Ctrl-\`` (hold down the Control key and press backtick, the key to the left of 1 on the keyboard).

### Navigation Commands

Try running the following commands in your Codespace terminal. To run a command, type it in and press enter.

`pwd`

`ls`

`ls .`

`cat README.md`

`cat README`

`cat does-not-exist`

`mkdir myfirstfolder`

`cd myfirstfolder`

`ls`

`ls .`

`pwd`

`touch file1.txt`

`touch file2.txt`

`ls`

`rm file2.txt`

`ls`

`ls ..`

`cd ..`

`pwd`

`ls`

`ls myfirstfolder`

**Discuss in your group and write down in notes**: For each complete command you just ran, write down your observations of what it did. Include both output you see at the terminal and any changes you see in the file navigation. Then, for the commands `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `touch`, `cat`, do your best to give a general description of the command. If you're not sure, that's okay! We'll talk more about all of these going forward, and after you are done trying this out, a staff member will add some definitions we have for them to your notes doc to make sure we have agreed-upon summaries.

### Downloading a File From the Command Line

Run the following command:

```
curl <fill link to .c file from class>
```

You should see the contents of an example from class. Then run this command:

```
curl -o hello.c <fill link to .c file from class>
```

You should see the file `hello.c` from class downloaded and saved into your Codespace. You can observe it in the file navigation, and with `ls` and `cat` (try all of them!).

Try opening the link from above in your browser.

`curl` takes a URL (a link) and downloads the contents. The optional `-o somefile` **command-line option** or **command-line flag** specifies an output file to save the contents to.

**Definition**: A **command-line option** or **command-line flag** is a way to give extra information to a program. Options are usually specified with a dash (`-`) followed by a letter or word. For example, `-o` is an option for `curl` that specifies an output file. The full list of options and flags is usually available by doing a search for the program online, or by using the command `man` (short for ‚Äúmanual‚Äù, nothing to do with dudes). Try running `man curl` at the terminal (the result may ‚Äútake over‚Äù your terminal, you can use the up and down arrows to scroll and `q` to get back to the command prompt).

### Logging into `ieng6`

As a student, you are assigned an account on the `ieng6` server hosted by UCSD. These are similar to accounts you might get on other systems at other institutions (or a future job). We‚Äôll see how to use your machine to connect to a remote computer over the Internet to do work there.

Your account name is the same account name as the one that‚Äôs used for your school Google account, i.e. it is the string that precedes ‚Äú@ucsd.edu‚Äù in your school email address. In case you need to check the status of your student account, refer to the [UCSD Student Account Lookup page](https://sal.ucsd.edu/).

Next run this command (with `yourusername` replaced by your actual username):

```
ssh yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

Since this is likely the first time you‚Äôve connected to this server, you will probably get a message like this:

```
$ ssh yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Copy and paste the one of the corresponding listed public key fingerprints and press enter.

TODO (staff, check these)

- If you see the phrase **ED25519 key fingerprint** answer with: SHA256:8vAtB6KpnYXm5dYczS0M9sotRVhvD55GYz8EjN1DYgs
- If you see the phrase **ECDSA key fingerprint** answer with: SHA256:/bQ70BSkHU8AEUqommBUhdAg0M4GaFIHLKq0YQyKvmw
- If you see the phrase **RSA key fingerprint** answer with: SHA256:npmS8Gk0l+zAXD0nNGUxr7hLeYPn7zzhYWVKxlfNaeQ

(Getting the fingerprint from a trusted source is the best thing to do here. You can also just type ‚Äúyes‚Äù, as it's pretty unlikely anything nefarious is going on. If you get this message when you're connecting to a server you connect to often, it could mean someone is trying to listen in on or control the connection. This answer is a decent description of what's going on and how you might calibrate your own risk assessment: [Ben Voigt's answer](https://superuser.com/questions/421074/ssh-the-authenticity-of-host-host-cant-be-established/421084#421084).)

After this, you get a prompt to enter your password. This is the same password you use to log into your student account on other websites, like Canvas and Tritonlink. The terminal itself does not show what you type when you enter your password. This is conventionally done for your own security, so that others looking at your screen don‚Äôt see it. Just trust that it gets inputted when you type.

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any commands you run will run on that computer! We call your computer the client and the computer in the basement the server based on how you are connected.

The whole interaction will look something like this:

```
# On your client
$ ssh yourusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6-202.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

To begin work for one of your courses [ cs15lwi24 ], type its name
at the command prompt.  (For example, "cs15lwi24", without the quotes).

To see all available software packages, type "prep -l" at the command prompt,
or "prep -h" for more options
```

Then, execute the following command:

```
cs15lfa24
```

You should get the following output:

```
Tue Oct 01, 2024 11:28pm - Prepping cs15lfa24
```

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any commands you run will run on that computer! We call your computer the client and the computer in the basement the server based on how you are connected.

If, in this process, you run into errors and can't figure out how to proceed, ask! When you ask, take a screenshot of your problem and add it to your group's running notes document, then describe what the fix was. If you don't know how to take a screenshot, ask!

### Running Commands, Remotely



 




## Build a C program (in both places)

Give them Hello.c from class, build + run both in Codespace and on ieng6.

Do something to make it have different behavior on the two systems! (environment
var, file, hostname, etc)

`ls ..` to show username dirs on ieng6, different layout entirely in the codespace

**Write down in notes**: compare/contrast
