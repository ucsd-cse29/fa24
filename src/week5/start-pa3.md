As demoed at the start of lab, for the next PA you'll be designing a webserver for a chat room. If you haven't already, take a look at the PA Starter <!-- ADD REPO LINK --> 

For this lab, we'll be working off of a similar starter. We'll use the same library to serve HTTP requests, but we'll instead be working on building a more simplistic server.
